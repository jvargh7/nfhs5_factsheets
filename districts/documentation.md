The present version of district data has not been cross-checked extensively. Please use with caution. Also, do let me know if you find any errors.

Known issues for district data parsing:
- Please refer to ~/districts/district_status.csv for a snapshot of what is available from different files as of now
- Kerala and Karnataka are presently displaying 2015-16 factsheets
- Indicator IDs are different across states
- There are known conversion issues for some symbols (e.g. \gt (greater than) is converted to â‰¥)
- Extraction for Meghalaya, Tripura and Himachal Pradesh is pending
- MH/Palghar and MH/Thane have parsing issues at the moment
